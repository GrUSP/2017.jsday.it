                Fraud syndrome, better known as impostor syndrome, is a common phenomena where someone feels like a fraud because
                they think everyone is better than themselves.
                <br />Working with JavaScript tends to generate this effect on developers, because there is always a new library to learn, and a new framework to master.
                <br />Despite their experience, every developer that interacted with JavaScript, has found themselves with a confused face while trying
                to understand the new technology everybody is talking about, just to have it replaced by another one in the incoming months.
                <br /><br />
                In this talk, Jose Aguinaga, author of "How it feels to learn Javascript in 2016" and experienced developer (he swears), will talk about JavaScript fatigue and
                better approaches to avoid the Fear Of Missing Out other than trying to learn everything that comes from HackerNews.
                <br />From his job in San Francisco, to teaching coding in Bali, Jose will share his personal experiences of working for multiple startups in various cities across the world, and share his views on how to learn the most popular (and unpopular) language in the world.

                <br />What are Chatbots? How can it benefit you? How do you write the code for it?
                <br />These questions will be answered during the session with step by step directions using node.js so you can easily follow along.

                In the components era, there are new tools and solutions available that transform completely the way we approach testing.<br />
                From snapshots, through end-to-end frameworks, to style guide testing.<br />

                In 2015, Michele Bertoli gave a talk titled "Unlearn everything" where he showed how React changed
                the way we write web applications and shared some ideas to work out of the comfort zone.
                <br />Michele ended his talk with a clear message that I took to heart: "Don't let what you learnt, prevent you to take a step forward".
                <br />Today, in 2017, for many of us React represent the confort zone... so where does the magic happens?
                <br />In this "sequel" session I will talk about Functional Reactive Programming with Cycle.js and how is taking the way we write web applications a step further.

                We work with many Javascript based tools in our day to day lives.
                <br />But how do we take those tools from being used by a single person on a machine and integrate it into a team's workflow?
                <br />How can we link those tool into chains and go from a tool to a process? :)
                <br /><br />
                In this talk I will discuss how I converted PhantomCSS, a tool for visual regression testing, and integrated it into our workflow. I will also cover the challenges we faced which ranged from integrating the tests into our CI, test execution taking too long, ability to browse the test results and notifying developers about failed regressions.

              Balsamiq Mockups, the popular tool for wireframing, was based on Adobe Flash/Air. We rewrote it from scratch using Javascript as main language, to make it run natively on the browser, while desktop and mobile versions are in the works.

              During this project, that took more than two years of work, we faced a lot of technical challenges in all fields: multiplatform architecture, UI performance
              , vector graphics, real time collaboration, management of a large codebase, ES6, debugging, automated and manual testing...
              <br />
              In this talk, centered on the web version of Balsamiq Wireframes (we also fixed the name!), I will discuss the choices we made, what worked well and what not so well, what we learned and... what we did not. :-)

                TypeScript is JavaScript on steroids. Not only it adds static typing to JavaScript applications, but it also adds ES2016+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, decorators,
                type guards and so on. These features are extremely powerful and help to write code in a simpler way compared to the past.
                <br /><br />In this sessions we’ll talk about these features and we’ll see how to use them to better solve from common to advanced problems.

                Were you a fan of animated cartoons as a kid, and wondered if one day you could create your own? Here's the great news: you can! Using open web standards and Ember.js you're able to create frame-by-frame animations—and even to make them interactive!
                <br /><br />This talk will explain why open web standards are more important than ever for creating animated content. We'll see how we can leverage the power of HTML5 Canvas in Ember efficiently and how to make animations interactive with the support of actions.

               At some point in my career I decided I wanted to quit software development and do an MBA.
               For a stroke of luck, I failed the admission test and I kept developing software.
               It was early 2010, and I did not know Node.js existed, and the impact it would have on my life.
               <br /><br />I wanted to speak at conferences, and I was terrible at it.
               <br /><br />Then, I was lucky to find a job that allowed me time to develop Open Source libraries.
               I was lucky that someone noticed one, and I went speaking at NodeConf.eu 2013.
               <br /><br />Now I travel the world as a consultant and conference speaker, and I maintain close to 200 OSS libraries. Open Source can change your life too, because there is no such thing as luck.

                In this CS101 we’ll explore some useful sorting algorithms currently used by popular JS engines such as Chrome's V8 and Firefox's SpiderMonkey.
                <br />We'll demystify O(n) notation, talk about performance, and take a look at the JS implementations of said algorithms. <br />As a developer, learning how these algorithms work, why and when to use them will help you solve complex problems in your web applications.

               We've been toying around with JS since 4 years, trying to figure out what's the best approach to build mobile-friendly
               apps that would offer the best performances on mobile devices.
               <br />We first went SPA and then decided to take a different approach.
               <br />2 years ago we presented a talk, at this very same conference, about how we decided to tackle our problems on mobile with an
                isomorphic application.
                <br /><br />Today, we would like to guide you through 2 years of that choice and why we decided to take a step back
                and go revamp our mobile website again, with server-side rendering and a pinch of React.

                IndexedDB is not new. It is supported in almost every browser.
                Without it, the future of progressive web apps are in peril.
                <br />But there is not a lot of love for it and that needs to change.
                <br />We'll investigate why we should love IndexedDB and the kind of apps you can create when you have the power of a database in the browser. Then we'll dive into how to use IndexedDB with a look at both the terrifying API and the friendly libraries that will help us along the way.
                <br /><br />Together we'll discover a new love for IndexedDB.
